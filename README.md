<p> This is a basic neural network with 3 hidden layers. It uses backpropagation to update the weights and sigmoid activation as a threshold function</p>
<p>The weights are initialized randomly using the relation: -1/sqrt(number_of_nodes) to 1/sqrt(number_of_nodes)</p>
<p> During training, the calculated error (target-desired) is backpropagated using the relation:
